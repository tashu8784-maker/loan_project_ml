**🧠 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning 💼
**
I recently completed an exciting machine learning project — Loan Approval Prediction — aimed at building a predictive model to determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant data.

This project involved a complete end-to-end data science workflow:
🔹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn and matplotlib
🔹 Handling missing and imbalanced data using SMOTE
🔹 Feature Scaling using MinMaxScaler
🔹 Model Building using Logistic Regression and KNN Classifier
🔹 Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix & Classification Report   

-**-Dataset**: Loan application dataset (with gender, education, employment, property area, loan amount, term, and status).

-**-Goal**: Predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on applicant details.

--**Techniques Used**:

*Data cleaning & EDA (using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

*Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE

*Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

*Model building with Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

*Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

-**-Insights:** Higher approval rate among applicants, and feature relationships visualized through plots.

**Key Learnings:**
✅ Data visualization and insight generation
✅ Balancing datasets for fair model training
✅ Evaluating performance metrics for classification models
✅ Understanding real-world financial decision modeling

**Tech Stack:**
🐍 Python | 📊 Pandas | 📉 Seaborn | 🤖 Scikit-learn | 🧩 Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of predictive modeling and how ML can assist in real-world financial decision-making.
